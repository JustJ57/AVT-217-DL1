        <h2>Design Objectives</h2>
            
        <p>
           The goal of this site will be to create a place that provides content to show my artistic and design capabilities. The site would provide a bit of info about myself, showcase my work, and offer a means of contacting me. In addition to artistic skill, I would like to also showcase some of my work in music and game making, so as to show a greater extent of my abilities. For the game making, I would include screenshots and/or videos showcasing the game projects I have completed.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
           In terms of design, I want to have something that shows off my style while also not being too "in your face." Something leaning on the more clean and professional side, but not being too simple as to lack personality. The site would be simple to navigate, with the different sections of my creative abilities split into different portfolio pages. That way, if someone wants to specifcally see my 2D art and design work, then they will have an easy means of finding it.
        </p>
